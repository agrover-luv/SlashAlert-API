"Amazing price tracking!","PriceTracker has saved me hundreds of dollars! I tracked a laptop for 2 weeks and caught it during a flash sale - saved $200!

"Saved me from overpaying!","I was about to buy a kitchen appliance at full price when PriceTracker alerted me to a 30% discount at another retailer.

"Good concept, needs improvement","The idea is great and it works most of the time. Sometimes I get notifications for price changes that aren't that significant.
